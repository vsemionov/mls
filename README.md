Machine Learning Snippets

A collection of reusable examples, created during my own learning process.


## Contents
* **nlp** - Transformer architecture implementation and sampling algorithms (beam search, top-k, top-p, etc).
* **gan** - Generative Adversarial Network implementations (pix2pix, CycleGAN, Wasserstein GAN with Gradient Penalty, Deep Convolutional GAN, basic GAN, etc).
* **poc** - Minimal proof-of-concept code for applications such as text generation, semantic search and face recognition.

Links to relevant sources (original papers or similar implementations) are included in source file headers.
